# Frog-Clock

For this project, I was really inspired by the iconic "Kit Cat Clock," which is a clock with eyes that tick on the second; so I made something similar, but with a frog. I put the time on the stomach in a visually interesting way, although it is simple. I did manage to make the eyes move on the second with assistance from a colleague. I wanted to make something aesthetically pleasing as best as I could with my limited knowledge of coding. I built it from scratch, however I did review other Open Processing sketches on how to build a frog. I used the p5js web editor to figure out how to make an arch, and I used my professors work to figure out how to make the time. Although this clock is not as involved as I would want it to be, it does still show the time and have its one moving part, which I'm pleased about. 
I would like to revisit this piece because I really do want it do have a bit more complexity, however I did fulfill the project criteria. I am proud of the work I've done in this class with no prior coding experience, but it was fairly frustrating at times since I didn't understand what was going on frequently. I'm glad to have gone through this though, and it was fun regardless.
